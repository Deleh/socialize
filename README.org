* socialize

  Ever felt lost in a group conversation?
  Don't worry, *socialize* is there to support you.

  It is a self-contained web page which asks socializing, funny and interesting questions.

** Installation

   For local usage you can just clone this repository and open the =index.html= file in your browser.

   If you want to host it, make the =index.html= and =favicon.png= files available via a webserver.

** Adding questions

   Fork this repo, add your questions to the =questions= array in the =index.html= file and submit a pull request :)

** Other application fields

   Even though this is called /socialize/, you can easily realize other things by replacing the question list:

   - Lottery
   - Fortuneteller
   - ...
